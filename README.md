# github-feed-back

Bring my GitHub feed back.

[GitHub just updated the feed](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-06-updates-to-your-github-feed/). This userscript helps you bring your old GitHub feed back.

## Install

1. First, install a userscript management browser extension: [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), etc.

2. Install this script from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/474720@latest) or [npmmirror](https://registry.npmmirror.com/github-feed-back/latest/files/dist/github-feed-back.user.js).

   You can also find it on [jsDelivr](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/github-feed-back@latest/dist/) or [UNKPG](https://unpkg.com/browse/github-feed-back@latest/dist/), however due to their cache strategies, you may have to manually switch to the latest version yourself.
